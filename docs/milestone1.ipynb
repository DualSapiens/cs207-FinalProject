    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Prompt] Describe problem the software solves and why it's important to solve that problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is used for [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation). Two other methods commonly used for numerical differentiation are symbolic differentiation and finite difference methods. The former calculates derivatives to machine precision but is computationally intensive and unreliable. The later is fast and easy but gives poor precision. Automatic differentation is a method that is both computationally efficient and reliable and also gives machine precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of numerical differentiation includes optimization, root-finding, and implicit time-integrator, all of which are widely used in science and engineering disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Prompt] Describe (briefly) the mathematical background and concepts as you see fit. You do not need to give a treatise on automatic differentation or dual numbers. Just give the essential ideas (e.g. the chain rule, the graph structure of calculations, elementary functions, etc). **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain Rule\n",
    "A central idea for automatic differentiation is chain rule. Generally, for $h = h\\left(y\\left(x\\right)\\right)$ where $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$, its gradient is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\nabla_{x}h = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y_{i}}\\nabla y_{i}\\left(x\\right)}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Graph\n",
    "To represent the operations, a graph structure is sometimes used. For example, for $f\\left(x\\right) = x - \\exp\\left(-2\\sin^{2}\\left(4x\\right)\\right)$, its graph would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "![comp-graph](figs/Computational-Graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall\n",
    "Knowing the graph of the computation, and derivatives of elementary functions, we would compute derivative of the entire function using chain rule efficiently.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How to Use Our Package - autodiff\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Prompt] How do you envision that a user will interact with your package? What should they import? How can they instantiate AD objects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: This section should be a mix of pseudo code and text. It should not include any actual operations yet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user would import our package, and instantiate variables and operations through our package's interface. The package will automatically compute the derivative for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "import autodiff\n",
    "\n",
    "x = autodiff.Var()\n",
    "y = autodiff.Var()\n",
    "f = 5*x**2+3*y\n",
    "x.set_value(5)\n",
    "y.set_value(3)\n",
    "assert f.der(x) == 50\n",
    "```\n",
