    "# Automatic Differentiation with *AutoDiff*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The *AutoDiff* package implements automatic differentiation, a technique for computing derivatives of functions that is distinct from both symbolic and numerical differentiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The merit of automatic differentiation is its ability to handle complicated functions without sacrificing the accuracy of the computed derivative. Whereas symbolic differentiation guarantees accuracy, it can be intractable for complex functions. By contrast, numerical differentiation affords ease in implementation and is amenable to any function, but it comes at the expense of accuracy. Automatic, or algorithmic, differentation is an alternative approach which allows derivatives to be computed by a computer program up to machine precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of numerical differentiation includes optimization, root-finding, and implicit time-integrator, all of which are widely used in science and engineering disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle behind automatic differentiation is the chain rule. Any complex function whose derivative we would like to compute can be expressed as the composition of elementary functions and operations. By obeying properties of the chain rule in tracing how the elementary operations make up the final function, an accompanying derivative of the function can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two flavors of algorithm for implementing automatic differentiation: the forward mode and the reverse mode. Here we will focus on the forward mode, which means that derivatives are computed starting from the most primitive building block - the independent variables of the function - to the most complex: the function itself. Following is a simple example of how the forward mode may be used determine the derivative of\n",

    "We can visualize the process as the gradual construction of a computational graph. The first two nodes of our graph, $x_1$ and $x_2$, take as input the independent variables of the function $f$. Their gradients $\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial x},\\dfrac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial y}\\right)$ have the seed values $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, respectively.\n",
