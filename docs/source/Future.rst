Future
========

We are looking for some cool applications that could be built up from our `autodiff` package. We have looked at some websites that
entail many field specific techniques that need to use automatic differentiation, i.e. a biomedicine optimization problem called 'Intensity
Modulated Radiation Therapy' which needs a high degree of accuracy for Jacobian. We were wondering if we could select one of them,
understand the general background of it, and build a comprehensive application that can be easily used by people
in that field who do not have many experiences with coding. Our software structure should contain both the `autodiff` module
and the application module that we want to build. We might want to package and distribute these two modules together.
